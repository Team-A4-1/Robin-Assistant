            <p class="HowdoesItWork__text">The carer can access Robin through the website www.Robinassists.me from a computer or any other internet enabled device and log in on their personal Dashboard. There, they can program the person’s tasks for the day, week, or even the entire month, with the option to modify them at any time. They can configure the order of the activities and the duration of each step for one or more persons, for instance. Moreover, they can establish an action for the “panic” button.</p>

            <p class="HowdoesItWork__text">The activities programmed by the carer in the online dashboard are sent to the individual’s Robin mobile application. When it is time to perform an activity, the app will notify the individual through an alert or notification. This will prompt them to open the scheduled activity in the Robin mobile app,</p>
